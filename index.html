                        areas, courts, aquatics, and common spaces. I regularly enforce facility policies, respond 
                        to emergencies, and handle incident reporting, while also delivering high-quality customer 
                        service by assisting patrons with questions, concerns, and membership needs. Through this position,

            </p>
            <div class="about_body">
                <p>
                    I am Jillian Bice, a Computer Science student at Florida State University with a strong interest in software engineering and IT support. My academic background
                    has given me hands-on experience in C++, C, C#, Python, JavaScript, and SQL, along with technologies such as React, Node.js, MySQL, and Google Cloud. I enjoy working across 
                    both frontend and backend development, and I am motivated by opportunities to learn new tools, solve challenging problems, and expand my technical expertise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Professionally, I serve as a Helpdesk IT Intern for FSU Facilities, where I troubleshoot hardware, software, and network issues while performing system maintenance and documenting 
                    solutions. Previously, I led a Software Engineering Capstone Project as Project Manager and Frontend Developer, where I coordinated a team of five to design and build a full-stack 
                    roommate-matching application. These experiences have strengthened my ability to apply technical knowledge to real-world problems while collaborating effectively within a team.
                </p> 
                <p>  
                    In addition to technical work, I’ve held several leadership and mentorship roles, including Vice President of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) at FSU, Peer Navigator for 
                    first-year students, and Facility Supervisor/Head Lifeguard at FSU Campus Recreation. These roles developed my communication, adaptability, and organizational skills, qualities that 
                    I bring into every project I take on.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Outside of my professional and academic pursuits, I enjoy hiking, spending time in nature, crocheting, reading, and traveling. These interests provide balance and creativity, 
                    which I carry back into my technical work. I am excited to continue growing as a developer and professional, open to opportunities where I can build, contribute, and make a meaningful impact.
