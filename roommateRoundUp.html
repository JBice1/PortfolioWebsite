                Tinder, but for roommates. Answer a questionnaire about your roommate preferences, 
                then get a Tinder-style interface that allows you to swipe left and right on certain 
                roommates. After both sides match with each other, the app starts a chat to allow both 
                sides to discuss specific information.

                This project is a roommate matching app. You start in the app by making an account and profile. 
                Part of the profile process is filling out a questionnaire via editing your profile that is about your roommate 
                preferences. After the questionnaire is completed, you get a Tinder-style interface that allows an individual to 
                swipe left (for no) and right (for yes) on certain roommates on your feed. If you and another person both swipe 
                right on each other it creates a match. If you match with a possible roommate it allows both sides to see the match 
                and message with that individual.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a sign-in page, sign-up page, a dashboard, a swiping page, a matches page, a messaging page, and a profile editor page. 
                The sign-in page will allow the user to enter a username and password. If the username and password is correct then it allows the 
                user to continue to the dashboard, where they can access the swipe page. Once on the swipe page, the user can swipe left and right 
                on possible roommates. The swipe page will have a navigation bar on the top that allows the user to access all the pages that were 
                specified above. Even though the site is not posted online, click the button below to see a video my group member made of the functionality 
                of the app. Continue reading below for more information about the project.

                For the front end, we utilized React with JSX for building reusable components and React Router to configure and manage website routes. 
                Styling was implemented with a combination of CSS and Tailwind CSS for a clean, consistent, and responsive design. 
            </p>
            <p>
                On the back end, we implemented Node.js to handle server-side logic. We used MySQL as our database solution, hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS)
                 for scalability and reliability. To interact with the database, we wrote and executed SQL queries for data management and retrieval.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I contributed extensively to the front-end development and styling of our roommate matching application. I implemented consistent CSS styling across 
                all pages—including the index, dashboard, swipe, matching, profile, edit profile, sign in, and sign up pages—ensuring a cohesive look and feel. This 
                included setting the background colors, color scheme, fonts, text box design, and button styling. I also fully styled the navigation bar for a clean and 
                user-friendly experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the functional side, I developed the feature that ends the swipe process once a user has viewed all possible matches, displaying a message and link to 
                the matches page instead. I also resolved a connectivity issue with the edit profile page, rebuilt its skeleton, and assisted teammates in making it fully
                 functional.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, I created the initial skeletons for the message and chat pages, worked collaboratively with Brandon C. on UX and UI design for several core pages 
                Sign Up, Dashboard, Home, Swipe), and added the project’s favicon (logo) to strengthen the app’s branding.
